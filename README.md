Is all about 
Pain point => resolution

Assuming business name is claritybyriver, lean into clarity theme:

My theme is clarity, so with each pain point I help people gain clarity on the situation, the problem, their strategy to address it, and how to follow through (importance of accountability)

I think this page can be designed as a dropdown list of pain points which, when expanded, describe what they can expect to gain clarity on and what the resolution will look like. It should not go into details on the process, (but I could have a separate page on that stuff such as philosophy and human design)

About page:

I spent 15 years of my life struggling with deep depression, feeling like it was truly hopeless to resolve issues with my mother and that she would forever be a source of incredible pain in my life. Then I had a mystical experience, a spiritual awakening which changed everything. I suddenly recognized the infinite potential in all humans, including her. I started to be able to make sense of why she was the way she was. Professionals had put all kinds of labels of psychosis on her and threw medications at her for years, none of which had any lasting benefit. But as I started to make sense of what was happening, I helped her to see it, accept it, and as I found the strength to forgave her, she was able to start to forgive those who hadn’t given her the support she needed. All of her symptoms are now gone. 
Overnight absolutely everything changed for our entire family. Simply by attaining clarity on what had seemed like an impossible situation to everyone for years. My life purpose became clear at that moment, I am here to aid others in gaining such clarity in their own lives.

Hi, I’m River Kanies. I’m an avid learner of all things tech, science, philosophy, economics, theology and practical psychology. I’ve been working closely with startup founders for over a decade, and in this time I found myself gradually focusing less and less on the products they wanted to build and more on the person, the human. Where does their drive come from? What is their vision for the future? The overarching mission? Their life philosophy? What is there philosophy around how a company should be run? What healthy workplace relationships look like? How to support employees in their journey of personal development? As I started to find my own answers to these questions, my own personal philosophy of life took shape. This process was finalized after my spiritual awakening, when I realized the answers were more human than technical, more archetypal and paradoxical than algorithmic. Now I’m focused fully on helping individuals navigate the paradoxical waters of human nature, to discover their spiritual journey arc, and break through to that next higher level of being wherever they are in life. Some are founders, working to start a business, some are aspiring youngsters still navigating school and early career options, some are stay at home mothers, some are rich executives who found themselves feeling empty. No matter your material situation in life, you always have opportunities for spiritual advancement, and these are the keys to whatever door you want to open be it material, social or internal.

I am a life coach, certified through the RMT program run by Tony Robbin’s and Cloe Madanes, world renowned for their track records for helping so many people make major breakthroughs and overcome even the most challenging situations. I bring a unique perspective to the coaching space with my strong personal philosophy of life, one which is based on cutting edge scientific discoveries in fields ranging from complexity theory to quantum mechanics, all brought together into a philosophical model which I have been published for. I pull on 10+ years of experience in technology and startup consulting to navigate the societal impacts of technological shifts including AI and blockchain so that my clients can stay ahead of these trends while staying true to their deepest nature. We’re living in wild times where it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the complexity and speed of technological advancements, but with an understanding of how to navigate the paradoxical waters of the spiritual plane on which all of this is taking place, this is a time of unrivaled potential for those who are curious tenacious and willing to boldly stand in their integrity. In the age of AI slop, authenticity is the new currency. I’m here to help the curious live their authentic lives by getting in touch with their deeper nature, those paradoxical/archetypal aspects that technological shifts and social conditioning can never change.
