                        <p class="quote-text">My focus is to help people learn from their struggles, and ultimately find meaning and purpose in that journey.</p>

                                <p>My main focus is personal story development, something I've been doing with myself and other startup founders for over a decade. It's something we all do to varying degrees on a near daily basis any time we take a moment to assess our long term goals and how we are working towards them. Our personal story is what we tell ourselves about who we are and why we're doing what we're doing. We are developing that story any time we modify it to better align with our motivational patterns and future vision.</p>

                                <p>At times it is powerful to bring an outside perspective into that space. This is something that happens almost accidentally, when catching up with an old friend for example. I am simply making an intentional practice of building a toolset to help make such narrative work as productive as it can be, offering my time and energy to people who want clarity in their self story.</p>
                                
                                <p>I want to help you turn challenging experiences into powerful lessons and ultimately find your life mission through that growth process. Our greatest lessons come from our greatest struggles, and the most powerful contributions we can make come from these lessons. It is through such contributions, that are so unique to our individual life story, that we can find a deep and lasting sense of fulfillment in life.</p>

                                <p>I am a life coach, certified through the RMT program run by Tony Robbin's and Cloe Madanes, world renowned for their track records for helping so many people make major breakthroughs and overcome some the most challenging situations. I bring a unique perspective to the coaching space with my strong personal philosophy of life, one which is based on cutting edge scientific discoveries in fields ranging from complexity theory to quantum mechanics, all brought together into a philosophical model which I have been <a href="https://www.essentiafoundation.org/simple-code-in-the-mind-of-god/reading/" target="_blank">published</a> for.</p>
                                <p>I pull on 10+ years of experience in technology and startup consulting to help my clients stay true to their deepest nature as they navigate the rapidly changing modern world. We're living in wild times where it's easy to get overwhelmed by the complexity and speed of technological advancements, but with an understanding of how to navigate the paradoxical waters of the spiritual plane (on which all of this is taking place), this is a time of unrivaled potential for those who are curious, tenacious, and willing to boldly stand in their integrity.</p>
                                <p>In the age of AI slop, authenticity is the new currency. I'm here to help the curious live their authentic lives by getting in touch with their <b>deeper nature, those paradoxical/archetypal aspects that technological shifts and social conditioning can never change.</b></p>

                                <p>Hi, I'm River Kanies. I'm an avid learner of all things tech, science, philosophy, economics, theology and practical psychology. I've been working closely with startup founders for over a decade, and in this time I found myself gradually focusing less and less on the products they wanted to build and more on the person, the human. Where does their drive come from? What is their vision for the future? The overarching mission? Their life philosophy? What is there philosophy around how a company should be run? What healthy workplace relationships look like? How to support employees in their journey of personal development?</p>
                                <p>As I started to find my own answers to these questions, my own personal philosophy of life took shape. This process was finalized after my spiritual awakening, when I realized <b>the answers were more human than technical, more archetypal and paradoxical than algorithmic.</b> Now I'm focused fully on helping individuals navigate the paradoxical waters of human nature, to discover their spiritual journey arc, and break through to that next higher level of being wherever they are in life.</p>
                                <p>Some are founders, working to start a business, some are aspiring youngsters still navigating school and early career options, some are stay at home mothers, some are rich executives who found themselves feeling empty. No matter your material situation in life, you always have opportunities for spiritual advancement, and these are the keys to whatever door you want to open be it material, social or internal.</p>

                                    <p>I spent 15 years of my life struggling with depression, feeling like it was truly hopeless to resolve issues with my mother and that she would forever be a source of incredible pain in my life. Then I had a mystical experience, a spiritual awakening which changed everything. It suddenly became clear to me that there is unlimited potential in all humans, including her. I started to be able to make sense of why she was the way she was.</p>
                                    <p>Over the years she had consulted with various mental health professionals and tried many medications, none of which had any lasting benefit. But as I started to make sense of what was happening, I helped her to see it, accept it, and as I found the strength to forgive her, she was able to start to forgive those who hadn't given her the support she needed.</p>
                                    <p>Her most problematic symptoms are now gone.</p>
                                    <p>In a moment, a transformation took place which has had profoundly beneficial effects on our whole family. What had seemed like an impossible situation to everyone for years melted away, simply by attaining clarity on what was really happening. 
                                    <p>My life purpose became clear in that moment: <b>I am here to aid others in gaining such clarity in their own lives.</b></p>
